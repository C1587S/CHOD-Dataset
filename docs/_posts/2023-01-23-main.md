The *CHOD* is a dataset of Entity Linking annotations built from digital descriptions of Museum Objects. We use as our Knowledge Base the [Getty Arts and Architecture Thesaurus](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/about.html), a controlled vocabulary describing terms associated with cultural heritage objects (predominantly materials, processes, objects, and attributes).

We document our work in the paper: "*Evaluating end-to-end entity linking on domain-specific knowledge bases: Learning about ancient technologies from museum collections*". You can find the first version (Dec, 2022) of the paper in the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s7ZAnphobSodeYXxGghEuWGyKTRGZGBj/view). 


## Abstract

One key challenge in applying novel NLP techniques  to social sciences is the problem of incorporating domain-specific knoweldge.  The knowledge base of choice among most entity linking techniques is Wikipedia, which covers various different domains without being specialized to a specific one. In this work, we evaluate End-to-End Entity Linking (EL) techniques on a use case relevant to social scientists, tagging all references in a text corpus to entities in a particular domain-specific knowledge base. We present a dataset of more than 2,000 descriptions and more than 10,000 entity annotations from a text corpus in digital humanities. We describe evaluation set-ups across different state-of-the-art baselines over three EL tasks: Mention detection (MD), Entity disambiguation (ED), and End-to-End Entity Linking. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuned model that outperforms all considered baselines. Our work benefits the NLP community by evaluating their techniques on an applied use case and the applied social sciences community by showing the usefulness of entity linking techniques for domain-specific text analysis.


## Example

The figure below exemplifies an end-to-end entity linking task for our use case. Each box contains recognized entities (Mention Detection). The green text represents the Process and Techniques facet, and the blue text represents the Object facet. The light-blue boxes include the most relevant candidates for entity linking (Candidate Generation), and the golden text indicates the correct candidate (Entity Disambiguation). Each integer identifier represents the corresponding AAT ID for each candidate.

Our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/C1587S/CHOD-Dataset) includes the relevant code to explore the dataset and make predictions with our fine-tuned version of the [ELQ model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/BLINK/tree/main/elq) for this usecase. 

## <img src="./assets/img/icon_nns.png"  width="3%"> Prediction example

**Basic Example**

Details of this prediction example below are provided in the following [link](https://github.com/C1587S/CHOD-Dataset/blob/master/tutorial_preds.ipynb)

**Prediction**

The ELQ model can make predictions of text descriptions of the following type:

1. "Figure (woman) wearing Rainbow Dance costume. Made of red, black, blue, gold painted earthenware."
2. "Figure (Gaá¹‡esa). Folk deity,seated feet crossed holding 2 lotuses. Made of bronze."


**Output format**

One example of the ELQ- output is as follows:

|**text**                                                                                            | **chunk_text**  | **chunk_start** | **chunk_end** | **aat**       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|

| figure (woman) wearing rainbow dance costume. made of red, black, blue, gold painted earthenware. | painted     | 77          | 84        | 300161986 |
| figure (woman) wearing rainbow dance costume. made of red, black, blue, gold painted earthenware. | earthenware | 85          | 96        | 300140803 |
| figure (ganesa). folk deity,seated feet crossed holding 2 lotuses. made of bronze.                | figure      | 0           | 6         | 300189808 |
| figure (ganesa). folk deity,seated feet crossed holding 2 lotuses. made of bronze.                | feet        | 35          | 39        | 300310200 |
| figure (ganesa). folk deity,seated feet crossed holding 2 lotuses. made of bronze.                | bronze      | 75          | 81        | 300010957 |


The "aat" column corresponds to the identity identifier in the [Getty Arts and Architecture Thesaurus catalog](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/?find=300140803&logic=AND&note=&english=N&prev_page=1). For example, the "300140803" AAT corresponds to the term "earthenware," whose description is: "Pottery with a porous body, fired below 1200 degrees Centigrade. It is not vitrified, and must be glazed to render it nonporous."
